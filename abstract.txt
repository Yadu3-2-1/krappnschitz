This project is a light‑hearted, interactive web application designed to entertain users with playful past life and future life predictions. The user simply provides their *name, **date of birth, and answers a quirky or silly question. Using these inputs, the system generates a humorous, unserious storyline describing who the user *might have been in a past life and what their future life could look like.  

The aim is not factual accuracy, but to deliver creative, amusing, and unexpected results that spark laughter and curiosity. The application blends randomization techniques with a pool of pre‑written whimsical scenarios, ensuring each visit feels unique. Whether you find out you were a "16th‑century royal giraffe trainer" or destined to be "the first pizza delivery astronaut," the project showcases how simple input processing can create personalized, shareable entertainment.
